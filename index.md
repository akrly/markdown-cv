## Experience

`2022 - Present`
**Copenhagen Fablab**

- **Volunteer** - I seized the opportunity during my relocation to learn and build 3-axis CNC mills using a LinuxCNC based system. 

`2017 - 2022`
**Maker's Red Box**, Budapest

I worked in several long term and project based roles:
- **Co-authored** "Green engineers", an immersive maker course that challenges students to solve engineering problems during a journey to Mars. My main role was to write the story, create and develop learning objectives, fuse them together and present it in a readily adaptable package to be used by educators. 
- **Prototype maker** Developed an environmental sensor shield for micro:bit in KiCad. 
- **Technical writer** - Created comprehensive technical documentation for multiple courses, covering mechanics, low voltage electronics, and programming in MicroPython and block-based IDEs.
- **Project manager** - Lead an instructional design team of 3 transforming teacher's guide books into engaging online courses using a CanvasLMS based stack.
- Conducted *induction courses* on makerspace and maker pedagogy for teachers, facilitating integration of making into their classrooms.
- Hosted monthly *webinars* for customers, addressing queries, demonstrating product features, and fostering engaging discussions.

`2017 - 2019`
**Milestone Institute**, Budapest

- **Mentor** - Provided individualized support and guidance to students in their intellectual development, career orientation, and emotional well-being. Mentored over 20 students, helping them navigate their path towards university courses and careers that align with their passions and goals.

`2016 - Present`
**Private tutor**

- **Independent** - I offer personalized one-on-one and small group sessions for students seeking project-based learning experiences. I cover various subjects such as natural sciences, engineering, media creation, and gastrophysics, tailoring the sessions to meet specific competence requirements. By leveraging my skills and experience, I facilitate hands-on projects that nurture students' curiosity and promote self-motivated learning, communication, and critical thinking skills.

`2015 - 2016`
**Palace of wonders** (Csodák Palotája), Budapest

- **Presenter** - Joined the museum's science communicators team and quickly took on responsibilities as a regular science show host. Demonstrated captivating experiments in an auditorium with a seating capacity of 200 guests. Additionally, contributed to the daily management of the institution and served as a shift lead, coordinating the staff.

## Projects I'm proud of

`2020`
[**MINTA**](https://worth-partnership.ec.europa.eu/projects/minta_en)

- **Facilitator and manufacturing partner** - Collaborated with Berlin-based textile designer Orsolya Orbán to develop new surfaces and structural designs for architecture and interior design using the art of weaving. The year-long collaboration resulted in the creation of a unique and innovative system. An art installation was exhibited online part of the Milan Design week in 2021 and the Museum of Ethnography, Budapest in 2022.

`2019`
