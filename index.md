## Experience

`2017 - 2022`
**Maker's Red Box**, Budapest

I worked in several long term and project based roles:
- **Prototype maker** Developed an environmental sensor shield for micro:bit.
- **Technical writer** - Developed content and documentation multiple courses. The topics included mechanics, low voltage electronics, programming in micropython and block based IDEs
- **Project manager** - Managed an instructional design team of 4 to transform teacher's guide books into online courses using a Canvas (Instructure) based stack.
- **Author** - Cowrote a maker course titled Green engineers. The story calls the students to embark on a journey to Mars. They face engineering, design challenges during each of the 16 x 2 hours long sessions. My main role was to write the story, create and develop learning objectives, fuse them together and present it in a readily adaptable package to be used by educators. 
- **Workshops & webinars**
    - *Induction to makerspace and maker pedagogy* - This is a 6 day course in which educators learn about tools and tech present in a typical makerspace. Throughout the course the participants also learn how to integrate making into their teaching.
    - *Product onboarding* - A monthly webinar for customers. 50% responding to questions and related topics. 50% feature demos.

`2017-2019`
**Milestone Institute**, Budapest

- **Mentor** - Providing individual support for students’ intellectual development, orientation, motivation and emotional welfare. Overall I mentored more than 20 students, but more importantly I could facilitate their way navigating to a university course and career that they are happy with and enjoy.

`2016-`
**Private tutor**

I take on students who look for project based one-on-one and small group sessions. Topics cover natural sciences, engineering, media creation, gastrophysics, while meeting outlined competence requirements. I employ my skills and experience to cater for the students curiosity and facilitate making based projects. Main goal is that the students exceed my subject knowledge in their chosen field whilst I focus on delivering key soft skills in communication, research, self-motivated learning and critical thinking.

`2015-2016`
**Presenter - Palace of wonders** (Csodák Palotája), Budapest

I joined and trained with the museums science communicators team and quickly got to host regular science shows and demonstrated popular experiments in an auditorium that could seat a 100 guests. Later on I got involved in the daily management of the institution and coordinated the staff as shift lead.

## Projects I'm proud of

`2020`

- [**Minta**](https://worthproject.eu/project/minta/), Facilitator and manufacturing partner

A year long collaboration between Orsolya Orbán, Berlin based textile designer. We teamed up to develop new surfaces and structural designs that can be used in architecture and interior design. Our solution is a system based on the art of weaving.

`2019`

- **Porond**

Collaboration with Csilla Horváth contemporary artist. Csilla created a sculpture based on a revolving circular stage, which was a common playground toy in our childhood. I built a custom MP3 player that detected if an audience member had the courage to climb up on the stage and played a pre-recorded applause.
